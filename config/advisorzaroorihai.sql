(11, 'insurance', 'Insurance', '<div class=\"product_text mb-5\"><p> Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.</p><p> An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or underwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer\'s promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship.</p><p> The insured receives a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster. The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.</p><p> Time is typically limited to choose the best insurance plan for your family, but rushing and picking the wrong one can be costly.

(12, 'loans', 'Loans', '<div class=\"product_text mb-5 text-left\"><p>A loan is essentially money borrowed with a promise of return within a specific time period/tenor.

Well you don’t have to anymore. Get in touch with our expert advisors today!</p><h1>Types of loans</h1><p>There are various types of loans available in India, and they are classified based on two factors:</p><ul class=\"mb-3 p-0\"><li>- Whether they require collateral</li><li>- The purpose they are used for</li></ul><p>Based on whether they require collateral, loans are classified into secured loans and unsecured loans.</p><h3 class=\"text-primary\">Secured loans</h3><p>These are loans that do require collateral, i.e., you have to provide an asset to the lender as security for the money you are borrowing. That way, if you are unable to repay the loan, the lender still has some means to get back their money. The rate of interest of secured loans tends to be lower as compared to those for loans without collateral.</p><h4 class=\"mb-3\">Types of secured loans</h4><ul class=\"insurance_list mb-3\"><li> <b>Home loan</b> Home loans are a secured mode of finance, that give you the funds to buy or build the home of your choice. The following are the type of home loans available in India:<p> <strong>Land purchase loan:</strong> Purchase land for your new home <strong>Home construction loan:</strong> Build a new home <strong>Home loan balance transfer:</strong> Transfer the balance of your existing home loan at a lower interest rate <strong>Top up loan:</strong> Can be used to renovate an existing home or have the latest interiors for your new home</p></li><li> <b>Loan against property (LAP)</b> Loan against property is one of the most common forms of a secured loan where you can pledge any residential, commercial or industrial property for availing the funds required. The loan amount disbursed is equivalent to a certain percentage of the property’s value and varies across lenders.</li><li> <b>Loans against insurance policies</b> Yes, you can also avail loans against your insurance policy. However, note that all insurance policies don’t qualify for this. Only policies,having a maturity value can be used to avail loans. <br> Thus, you can’t avail a loan against a term insurance plan as it doesn’t have any maturity benefits.</li><li> <b>Gold loans</b> A gold loan requires you to pledge gold jewellery or coins as collateral. The loan amount sanctioned is a certain percentage of the gold’s value pledged. Gold loans are generally used for short-term needs and have a short repayment tenor compared to home loans and loan against property.</li><li> <b>Loans against mutual funds and shares</b> An ideal vehicle for long-term wealth creation, mutual funds can also be pledged as collateral for a loan. You can pledge equity or hybrid funds to the financial institution for availing a loan.</li><li> <b>Loans against fixed deposits</b> The humble fixed deposit not only offers assured returns but can also come handy when you need a loan. The amount of loan can vary between 70-90% of the FD’s value and varies across lenders. However, it’s essential to note that the loan tenor can’t be more than the FD’s tenor.</li></ul><hr><h3 class=\"text-primary\">Unsecured loans</h3><p>These are loans that do not require collateral. The lender lends you the money based on past associations, and your credit score and history. Thus, you have to have a good credit history to avail these loans. Unsecured loans usually come at a higher rate of interest due to the lack of collateral.</p><h4 class=\"mb-3\">Types of unsecured loans</h4><ul class=\"insurance_list mb-3\"><li> <b>Personal loan</b> Offering an instant flush of liquidity, a personal loan is one of the most popular types of unsecured loans. However, since a personal loan is an unsecured mode of finance, the interest rates are higher compared to secured loans. A good credit score along with high and stable income ensures you can avail this loan at a competitive rate of interest.</li><li> <b>Short-term business loansn</b> Another type of unsecured loans, a short-term business loan can be used to meet their expansion and daily expenses by various entities and organizations.</li></ul><hr><h3 class=\"text-primary\">Flexi Loans</h3><p>A facility whereby you can avail funds from your approved limit and as when required and pay interest only on the amount used. You can withdraw on your loan limit, any number of times and prepay when you have extra cash, at no extra cost. Such a unique facility gives you the freedom to be in full control of your finances unlike rigid term loans and offers you savings on your EMIs by up to 45%. Here, you also have the option to pay only interest as EMIs, with the principal payable at the end of the tenor.</p><ul class=\"insurance_list mb-3\"><li> <b>Education loans</b> Aspiration for higher education from reputed institutions have bolstered the demand for education loans in the country. This loan covers the basic fees of the course along with allied expenses such as the accommodation, exam fee, etc. In this loan, the student is the main borrower while parents, siblings and spouse are co-applicants.</li><li> <b>Vehicle loans</b> A vehicle loan is extended in the form of a two or four-wheeler loan which helps you to buy your dream vehicle. Vehicle loans are offered either on purchase of a new vehicle or a used one. Your credit score, ratio of debt to income, loan tenor, etc., play a crucial role in determining the loan amount.</li></ul></div>');

During the acquisition of a property, an investor will typically make a formal offer to buy including payment of &quot;earnest money&quot; to the seller at the start of negotiation to reserve the investor&#39;s rights to complete the transaction if price and terms can be satisfactorily negotiated.</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\"><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading\"><a class=\"e-learning-a\" href=\"#collapse3\">Start-Ups</a></div><div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"collapse3\"><div class=\"panel-body\"><ul><li>Startup capital is a financial investment in the development of a new company or product.

Investment banks underwrite new debt and equity securities for all types of corporations, aid in the sale of securities, and help to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, reorganizations and broker trades for both institutions and private investors. Investment banks also provide guidance to issuers regarding the issue and placement of stock.</li><li>Many large investment banking systems are affiliated with or subsidiaries of larger banking institutions, and many have become household names, the largest being Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. Broadly speaking, investment banks assist in large, complicated financial transactions. They may provide advice on how much a company is worth and how best to structure a deal if the investment banker&rsquo;s client is considering an acquisition, merger or sale. It may also include the issuing of securities as a means of raising money for the client groups, and creating the documentation for the Securities and Exchange Commission necessary for a company to go public.</li><li>Investment banks employ investment bankers who help corporations, governments and other groups plan and manage large projects, saving their client time and money by identifying risks associated with the project before the client moves forward. In theory, investment bankers are experts in their field who have their finger on the pulse of the current investing climate, so businesses and institutions turn to investment banks for advice on how best to plan their development, as investment bankers can tailor their recommendations to the present state of economic affairs.</li><li>Essentially, investment banks serve as middlemen between a company and investors when the company wants to issue stock or bonds. The investment bank assists with pricing financial instruments to maximize revenue and with navigating regulatory requirements. Often, when a company holds its initial public offering (IPO), an investment bank will buy all or much of that company&rsquo;s shares directly from the company. Subsequently, as a proxy for the company holding the IPO, the investment bank will sell the shares on the market. This makes things much easier for the company itself, as they effectively contract out the IPO to the investment bank.</li><li>Moreover, the investment bank stands to make a profit, as it will generally price its shares at a markup from the price it initially paid. In doing so, it also takes on a substantial amount of risk. Though experienced analysts use their expertise to accurately price the stock as best they can, the investment bank can lose money on the deal if it turns out it has overvalued the stock, as in this case it will often have to sell the stock for less than it initially paid for it.</li></ul></div><div class=\" contentHeader5\">&nbsp;</div></div></div></div><div class=\"e-learning-div\"><div

The success of an actively managed fund depends on a combination of in-depth research, market forecasting, and the expertise of the portfolio manager or management team. Portfolio managers engaged in active investing pay close attention to market trends, shifts in the economy, changes to the political landscape, and news that affects companies. This data is used to time the purchase or sale of investments in an effort to take advantage of irregularities. Active managers claim that these processes will boost the potential for returns higher than those achieved by simply mimicking the holdings on a particular index.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"e-learning-div\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-8\"><h5><a class=\"e-learning-a\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#knowledge_7\">Portfolio management service</a></h5></div><div class=\"col-4\"><a class=\"e-learning-a\" href=\"#\"><img class=\"e-learning-img img-responsive\" src=\"assets/img/knowledge/knowledge_portfolio.png\" /></a></div></div></div></div><div class=\"col-md-4 pbDiv\"><div class=\"modal fade\" id=\"knowledge_8\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"knowledge_8\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><div class=\"modal-dialog modal-lg\" role=\"document\"><div class=\"modal-content\"><div class=\" contentDesc8\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\" contentHeader8\"><p>What is Goods and Service Tax (GST)?</p><div class=\"panel-group\"><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><ul><li>It is a destination based tax on consumption of goods and services.

Further, 8 both would be levied on the same price or value unlike State VAT which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive of CENVAT.

By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax and allowing set-off of prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading and pave the way for a common national market. For the consumers, the biggest gain would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%.</li><li>Introduction of GST would also make our products competitive in the domestic and international markets. Studies show that this would instantly spur economic growth. There may also be revenue gain for the Centre and the States due to widening of the tax base, increase in trade volumes and improved 10 tax compliance. Last but not the least, this tax, because of its transparent character, would be easier to administer.</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class=\"panel-group\" id=\"accordion\"><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading\"><a class=\"e-learning-a\" href=\"#collapse4\">What is IGST?</a></div><div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"collapse4\"><div class=\"panel-body\"><ul><li>Under the GST regime, an Integrated GST (IGST) would be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-State supply of goods and services.

The GSTN would also be integrating the common GST portal with the existing tax administration IT systems and would be building interfaces for tax payers. Further, the GSTN is developing back-end modules like assessment, audit, refund, appeal etc. for 19 States and UTs (Model II States). The CBEC and Model I States (15 States) are themselves developing their GST back-end systems. Integration of GST front-end system with back-end systems will have to be completed and tested well in advance for making the transition smooth.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"e-learning-div\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-8\"><h5><a class=\"e-learning-a\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#knowledge_8\">Goods &amp; Service Tax</a></h5></div><div class=\"col-4\"><a class=\"e-learning-a\" href=\"#\"><img class=\"e-learning-img img-responsive\" src=\"assets/img/knowledge/knowledge_gst.jpg\" /></a></div></div></div></div></div>');
